# Installation

As a prerequisite, you should install [SimBal](https://github.com/keremkoseoglu/simbal) first.

You may install Addict to your system using [abapGit](https://github.com/abapGit/abapGit).

If you are using a ticketing system, it is recommended (but not required) to install and implement [TickSys](https://github.com/keremkoseoglu/ticksys) to help with your ticket system management with ABAP.
